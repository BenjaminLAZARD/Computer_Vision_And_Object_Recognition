# Computer Vision and Object Recognition

In this repository, you'll find the labs and final project from the corresponding [ENS Ulm](http://www.ens.fr/en/ens/facts-and-rankings/international-rankings) course by Pr. [Jean Ponce](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jean-ponce-2302986/?originalSubdomain=fr), [Ivan Laptev](https://www.di.ens.fr/~laptev/), and [Cordelia Schmidt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordelia-schmid-47985a9/?originalSubdomain=fr), 2019 edition.

Though my solutions are free to use, the course material is the exclusive property of the professors. 

The topics covered are the following ones:

1. Lab1: Introduction to Local Invariant Features using [Scale Invariant Feature Transform: SIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform) points of interests, image matching using [Bags of Visual Words: BOVW](https://towardsdatascience.com/bag-of-visual-words-in-a-nutshell-9ceea97ce0fb). Given a picture of a portion of a painting and a database of scans of paintings, identify the original picture.

2. Lab2: Introduction to [Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/): [convolution operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), backpropagation of the gradient (impact of learning rate, initialization, number of hidden units) on a simple 1-layer MLP, custom CNN built with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (non-linear activation functions, pooling, training on [CIFAR 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFAR-10)).

3. Final project: coming soon  ![wink_smiley](http://cdn.onlinewebfonts.com/svg/img_431499.png)
